MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: En route.
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completed.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: Pending completion.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Hardware complete, code pending completion.
3D PRINTING: Pending completion.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS: 
  3D print a pulley and test the motor.
  Put in electrical safety components such as 11V regulator for motor driver, external flyback diode on motor and fuses.
  Calculate total current required across each subsystem.
  
CHALLENGES:
  Can't calculate current until testing of motor is complete.
  Can't implement solenoid until testing is complete which also prevents calculation of total current.
  Need to solve for how the arduino will know where the monkey is at any one time.
  
NOTES:
  Best idea for 3rd challenge is to have a mechanical stop that the monkey triggers at which point the motor changes direction
  and continues to hoist the monkey until it is tripped again i.e. the pulley fully coils around twice.

THOUGHTS: 
  Maybe a rotational encoder would be beneficial to track the speed of the motor. An IR gateway as a failsafe to the
  mechanical trigger could be important too.

MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: Driver has arrived, motor will arrive soon.
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completed.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: Pending completion.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Hardware complete, code pending completion.
3D PRINTING: Pending completion.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS: 
  3D print a pulley and test the motor.
  External flyback diode on motor and fuses.
  Calculate total current required across each subsystem.
  With a constant load of 1A a 720mΩ resistor is required to drop the voltage such that the driver only works with 11v
  N.B. this is calculated using the 280mΩ resistance of the transistors of the driver itself (it would be suitable to use
  a potentiometer between 0 and 1000mΩ.
  
CHALLENGES:
  Can't calculate current until testing of motor is complete.
  Can't implement solenoid until testing is complete which also prevents calculation of total current.
  - Solved for knowing position of monkey (refer to notes) -
  
NOTES:
  Using a push button an attachment to the line supporting the monkey will be activated when the monkey is winched up
  completely and will then swap the motor direction at the same speed. The monkey will go all the way down and then back
  up which will trigger the push button again. The arduino can track the time between button pushes via interrupts thus
  allowing it to calculate the distance as it knows the speed. This allows the arduino to know where the "bottom" of the
  monkey's range of motion is thus allowing the user to use any length of line and still accurately stop at the bottom
  when given the command.
  
  The following link is to a slug lock-solenoid that would be suitable for the locking mechanism at power off.

  The following link is to the design of the circuit which also includes code.
  https://www.circuito.io/app?components=9442,11113,305155,848753,7654322
  
THOUGHTS:
  The IR gateway can double as a range finder (depending on its maximum reliable range) which can increase the accuracy
  the arduino can calculate the distance to the bottom by. The rotational encoder is an unnecessary complexity. More
  research into how to use the driver and all of its functionality is required i.e. braking, sleeping etc. Maybe a bigger
  power supply will be required due to only 1.5A of current being available, not everything may be fully powered.

MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: Arrived, modelling in progress.
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completeted.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: A new motor driver is en route which may require a higher amperage transformer.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Hardware complete, coding, modelling and testing to follow.
3D PRINTING: Test pulley in progress, case to be completed.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS:
  Model the motor's no load speed, stall current and total power consumption. (Optionally model noise and temperature).
  Get motor running with current driver and power the arduino and motor from the transformer.
  Complete electrical circuit analysis and incorporate external flybacks (if required).
  
CHALLENGES:
  Motor modelling must be completed before electrical circuit analysis can be carried out.
  Solenoid needs to be modelled to assist in the electrical circuit analysis, as well as determining if more power is required.
  Position finding with timing between triggers needs to be tested as well as edge tested.
  
NOTES:
  Fuses need to be accounted for in the electrical analysis. Speak with the electrician in regards to whether a fuse should be in
  place before any electronics or if before the motor is enough.
  
  Need to research flyback diodes and check if the driver already has them.
  
THOUGHTS:
  A solenoid might fail edge testing thus needs to be carefully modelled and should lose power before the motor.
  Concealing the entire system in a plastic bunch of bananas with non-flammable insulation between the case and the bananas that
  can act as a noise dampener would be a nice touch.
  Finally, temperature modelling the components inside the case, as well as flame/auto ignition testing the 3D printed case would
  be a huge bonus as being a very safe system in the event of an edge case failure.

MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: Driver testing completed, motor I - T curve pending completion
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completeted.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: Completed, but a bigger transformer may be required for future upgrades.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Hardware complete, coding underway.
3D PRINTING: Test pulley in progress, case to be completed.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS:
  Test the motor driver to see if it can power the Arduino.
  Research higher power transformers for future upgrades.
  Model the I-T curve of the motor.
  
CHALLENGES:
  ^^
  Determine whether or not a solenoid is required by observing the motor coasting under load.
  Push button testing and debounce modelling needs to begin to safely and reliably control the motor.
  
NOTES:
  The small driver has inbuilt back-emf suppression but the larger driver may not.
  
THOUGHTS:
  The outputs for the motor of the larger driver could potentially supply multiple medium-sized motors thus negating the need for
  multiple drivers. This has a limitation of all motors being in sync so the only way to offset each monkey/spider is to have varying
  lengths of line from each motor to each respective monkey/spider.
  
  The push button may be bouncy and might not always trigger effectively. This demands a rigorous design for how the push button 
  interacts with the monkey as well as either an RC debounce circuit or interrupt rising/falling edge code.
  
  Finally, the time between each button press gives the Arduino the total time of each cycle but if the monkey is interferred with or
  the power to the motor unexpectedly drops temporarily this time measurement will become invalid. As such the Arduino should store
  the previous 10 cycle times and average that then compare the average with the newest time.

  Using a pulley will linearly increase torque with winding width but a worm gear will maintain a constant torque. With a pulley the
  monkey will slow down as it reaches the apex of it's motion making it seem like the monkey nearly reached the bananas but then got too
  tired and rapidly falls back down.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************

NOTES: 
  Nothing much has changed but a plastic bunch of bananas is on its way and for the Roomba idea, the bananas can make a protective
  shroud which can be designed to look like a thrown for a glove monkey to sit on. It can have a servo in its neck to make its
  head look side to side and using the 360 degree camera a "A Day in the Life of a Monkey King" can be made with the tiny planet
  feature. Adding a speaker playing George of the Jungle drum theme would help to alert people it is approaching making it less of
  a tripping hazard. Pretty novel, pretty easy.
  
*****************************************************************************************************************************************
10/03/18

NOTES:
  The transformer can't provide the needed current without hitting a safety switch so a bigger transformer is required. For now a 
  series of large batteries should cut it.
    
*****************************************************************************************************************************************
13/03/18

NOTES:
  A larger transformer works but the motor will need a thermistor to lock out current at a certain temperature. The pulley can work as
  a complicated worm gear or an elegant wide pitch pulley as the fishing line tends to wrap in an orderly function on its own.

MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: Previous motor cannot output enough power, new motor en route.
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completeted.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: New higher power transformer en route along with a current in rush limiter.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: 12V Regulator required to dissipate 24V power from supply.
3D PRINTING: 3D printing on hold until new motor arrives.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS:
  Connect the new power supply to the motor and model the motor.
  Connect the new power supply to the 12v regulator and the arduino to test the temperature.
  Connect the in rush current limiter and check current through the circuit as well as temperature.
  
CHALLENGES:
  The output shaft is already 10mm so a constant radius of the coupler/pulley will be required to maintain a comfortable torque
  buffer.
  The system may require heat sinking, particularly the 12v regulator.
  
NOTES:
  A current sensing resistor may be required to help prevent stalling and thus temperature increasing in the motor.
  
THOUGHTS:
  A slower monkey is not a bad thing. It will reach up slowly for the bananas and then coast (pseudo freefall) and the motor can
  slow it down right before the bottom of its arc.
  Being a slower motor means that a lower duty cycle where the monkey is moving imperciptibly but by the end of half an hour it will
  have moved considerably, adding a sense of magic to how the monkey moves.
  Having two of these systems for both monkeys in the middle of the gym will add considerable value to the experience as well as
  help contain parties by the kids remembering not to cross to the wrong side because the floating monkeys are there.
  A spider rapelling from its web in the disco area would be very novel as well. There is potential to generate a number of
  models that complement each other whilst seamlessly working in tandem off one remote.

MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: New motor arrived and works well.
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: New toggle type receiver en route.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: A reverse voltage protector is en route.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Regulator arrived and a battery can be useful to keep the Arduino on.
3D PRINTING: Will complete when PCB and props in place.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS:
  Set up the admin mode to calibrate the bottom point of the arc.
  Set up the code to make the monkey have a nice ramp speed at both peaks of the arc.
  Set up the code to ramp the speed through 0 - 255 so that the user can select which speed they desire.
  
CHALLENGES:
  Need aluminium output shaft and potentially heatsinks for the motor driver and the reverse voltage protector.
  Need to accomodate for heatsinks in the 3D printed case.
  Need to test the whole setup in the field.
  
NOTES:
  The toggle type will be useful as the interrupts can detect changes thus the user can turn the motor on/off, cycle speed and select
  the preferred speed, change direction and have a free button for another setting.
  
THOUGHTS:
  The 9V battery will work for a short time but cannot output much current so a higher mAh battery will likely be required for keeping
  the Arduino on.
  As there is a free button maybe it can be used to initiate the admin mode for calibrating the arc, but also, when activated, altering
  the effects of the other buttons to complete other tasks. The admin mode should be able to be turned off with the same pattern as
  was used to turn it on or go to autonomous mode after 2 min of no input.
  
  This point is important for the business model of these projects: There is potential to generate a number of
  models that complement each other whilst seamlessly working in tandem off one remote.

ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Regulator arrived and a battery can be useful to keep the Arduino on.
3D PRINTING: Will complete when PCB and props in place.
PCB: Pending completion.

NOTES:
  During calibration to find bottom of arc the motor should turn slowly to not overdraw current at the bottom or fall too quickly.
  It might be worth capping the motor's PWM to 75% so that it can't free fall per se. The reason for this is that when the motor speed
  changes from very fast to very fast in the opposite direction it draws a huge current.
  Key printed and placed but not Loctite'd in place yet.
  
**************************************************************************************************************************************
31/07/19
THE FIX FOR THE POWER SUPPLY DEPENDS ON THE TOTAL RESPONSE OF THE MOTOR! A sudden change of PWM duty cycle causes a spike in voltage
which overloads the PSU if the PWM is already near 100%. The fix is to keep the PWM at a threshold point where even the largest
spike has no effect.

Will implement fix when new Arduino Unos arrive.
