MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: Driver has arrived, motor will arrive soon.
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completed.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: Pending completion.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Hardware complete, code pending completion.
3D PRINTING: Pending completion.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS: 
  3D print a pulley and test the motor.
  External flyback diode on motor and fuses.
  Calculate total current required across each subsystem.
  With a constant load of 1A a 720mΩ resistor is required to drop the voltage such that the driver only works with 11v
  N.B. this is calculated using the 280mΩ resistance of the transistors of the driver itself (it would be suitable to use
  a potentiometer between 0 and 1000mΩ.
  
CHALLENGES:
  Can't calculate current until testing of motor is complete.
  Can't implement solenoid until testing is complete which also prevents calculation of total current.
  - Solved for knowing position of monkey (refer to notes) -
  
NOTES:
  Using a push button an attachment to the line supporting the monkey will be activated when the monkey is winched up
  completely and will then swap the motor direction at the same speed. The monkey will go all the way down and then back
  up which will trigger the push button again. The arduino can track the time between button pushes via interrupts thus
  allowing it to calculate the distance as it knows the speed. This allows the arduino to know where the "bottom" of the
  monkey's range of motion is thus allowing the user to use any length of line and still accurately stop at the bottom
  when given the command.
  
  The following link is to a slug lock-solenoid that would be suitable for the locking mechanism at power off.

  The following link is to the design of the circuit which also includes code.

THOUGHTS:
  The IR gateway can double as a range finder (depending on its maximum reliable range) which can increase the accuracy
  the arduino can calculate the distance to the bottom by. The rotational encoder is an unnecessary complexity. More
  research into how to use the driver and all of its functionality is required i.e. braking, sleeping etc. Maybe a bigger
  power supply will be required due to only 1.5A of current being available, not everything may be fully powered.

MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: En route.
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completed.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: Pending completion.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Hardware complete, code pending completion.
3D PRINTING: Pending completion.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS: 
  3D print a pulley and test the motor.
  Put in electrical safety components such as 11V regulator for motor driver, external flyback diode on motor and fuses.
  Calculate total current required across each subsystem.
  
CHALLENGES:
  Can't calculate current until testing of motor is complete.
  Can't implement solenoid until testing is complete which also prevents calculation of total current.
  Need to solve for how the arduino will know where the monkey is at any one time.
  
NOTES:
  Best idea for 3rd challenge is to have a mechanical stop that the monkey triggers at which point the motor changes direction
  and continues to hoist the monkey until it is tripped again i.e. the pulley fully coils around twice.

THOUGHTS: 
  Maybe a rotational encoder would be beneficial to track the speed of the motor. An IR gateway as a failsafe to the
  mechanical trigger could be important too.

MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: Arrived, modelling in progress.
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completeted.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: A new motor driver is en route which may require a higher amperage transformer.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Hardware complete, coding, modelling and testing to follow.
3D PRINTING: Test pulley in progress, case to be completed.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS:
  Model the motor's no load speed, stall current and total power consumption. (Optionally model noise and temperature).
  Get motor running with current driver and power the arduino and motor from the transformer.
  Complete electrical circuit analysis and incorporate external flybacks (if required).
  
CHALLENGES:
  Motor modelling must be completed before electrical circuit analysis can be carried out.
  Solenoid needs to be modelled to assist in the electrical circuit analysis, as well as determining if more power is required.
  Position finding with timing between triggers needs to be tested as well as edge tested.
  
NOTES:
  Fuses need to be accounted for in the electrical analysis. Speak with the electrician in regards to whether a fuse should be in
  place before any electronics or if before the motor is enough.
  
  Need to research flyback diodes and check if the driver already has them.
  
THOUGHTS:
  A solenoid might fail edge testing thus needs to be carefully modelled and should lose power before the motor.
  Concealing the entire system in a plastic bunch of bananas with non-flammable insulation between the case and the bananas that
  can act as a noise dampener would be a nice touch.
  Finally, temperature modelling the components inside the case, as well as flame/auto ignition testing the 3D printed case would
  be a huge bonus as being a very safe system in the event of an edge case failure.

MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: Driver testing completed, motor I - T curve pending completion
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completeted.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: Completed, but a bigger transformer may be required for futre upgrades.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Hardware complete, coding underway.
3D PRINTING: Test pulley in progress, case to be completed.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS:
  Test the motor driver to see if it can power the Arduino.
  Research higher power transformers for future upgrades.
  Model the I-T curve of the motor.
  
CHALLENGES:
  ^^
  Determine whether or not a solenoid is required by observing the motor coasting under load.
  Push button testing and debounce modelling needs to begin to safely and reliably control the motor.
  
NOTES:
  The small driver has inbuilt back-emf suppression but the larger driver may not.
  
THOUGHTS:
  The outputs for the motor of the larger driver could potentially supply multiple medium-sized motors thus negating the need for
  multiple drivers. This has a limitation of all motors being in sync so the only way to offset each monkey/spider is to have varying
  lengths of line from each motor to each respective monkey/spider.
  
  The push button may be bouncy and might not always trigger effectively. This demands a rigorous design for how the push button 
  interacts with the monkey as well as either an RC debounce circuit or interrupt rising/falling edge code.
  
  Finally, the time between each button press gives the Arduino the total time of each cycle but if the monkey is interferred with or
  the power to the motor unexpectedly drops temporarily this time measurement will become invalid. As such the Arduino should store
  the previous 10 cycle times and average that then compare the average with the newest time.
