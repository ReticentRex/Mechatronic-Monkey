MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: Driver has arrived, motor will arrive soon.
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completed.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: Pending completion.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Hardware complete, code pending completion.
3D PRINTING: Pending completion.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS: 
  3D print a pulley and test the motor.
  External flyback diode on motor and fuses.
  Calculate total current required across each subsystem.
  With a constant load of 1A a 720mΩ resistor is required to drop the voltage such that the driver only works with 11v
  N.B. this is calculated using the 280mΩ resistance of the transistors of the driver itself (it would be suitable to use
  a potentiometer between 0 and 1000mΩ.
  
CHALLENGES:
  Can't calculate current until testing of motor is complete.
  Can't implement solenoid until testing is complete which also prevents calculation of total current.
  - Solved for knowing position of monkey (refer to notes) -
  
NOTES:
  Using a push button an attachment to the line supporting the monkey will be activated when the monkey is winched up
  completely and will then swap the motor direction at the same speed. The monkey will go all the way down and then back
  up which will trigger the push button again. The arduino can track the time between button pushes via interrupts thus
  allowing it to calculate the distance as it knows the speed. This allows the arduino to know where the "bottom" of the
  monkey's range of motion is thus allowing the user to use any length of line and still accurately stop at the bottom
  when given the command.
  
  The following link is to a slug lock-solenoid that would be suitable for the locking mechanism at power off.

  The following link is to the design of the circuit which also includes code.

THOUGHTS:
  The IR gateway can double as a range finder (depending on its maximum reliable range) which can increase the accuracy
  the arduino can calculate the distance to the bottom by. The rotational encoder is an unnecessary complexity. More
  research into how to use the driver and all of its functionality is required i.e. braking, sleeping etc. Maybe a bigger
  power supply will be required due to only 1.5A of current being available, not everything may be fully powered.

MOTOR SUBSYSTEM: En route.
RADIO SUBSYSTEM: Completed.
POWER SUBSYSTEM: Pending completion.
ARDUINO SUBSYSTEM: Hardware complete, code pending completion.
3D PRINTING: Pending completion.
PCB: Pending completion.

GOALS: 
  3D print a pulley and test the motor.
  Put in electrical safety components such as 11V regulator for motor driver, external flyback diode on motor and fuses.
  Calculate total current required across each subsystem.
  
CHALLENGES:
  Can't calculate current until testing of motor is complete.
  Can't implement solenoid until testing is complete which also prevents calculation of total current.
  Need to solve for how the arduino will know where the monkey is at any one time.
  
NOTES:
  Best idea for 3rd challenge is to have a mechanical stop that the monkey triggers at which point the motor changes direction
  and continues to hoist the monkey until it is tripped again i.e. the pulley fully coils around twice.

THOUGHTS: 
  Maybe a rotational encoder would be beneficial to track the speed of the motor. An IR gateway as a failsafe to the
  mechanical trigger could be important too.
